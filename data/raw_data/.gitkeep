# Data Placeholder

This directory will contain the actual raw numerical data from simulations.

## Expected Files

The following data files should be placed here:

1. **ground_state_energies.npz** - Ground state energies for various system sizes
2. **order_parameters.npz** - Order parameters (magnetization, density, etc.)
3. **correlation_functions.npz** - Two-point correlation functions
4. **entanglement.npz** - Entanglement measures

## Data Generation

These files are generated from quantum many-body simulations. 

To generate the data:
1. Run your simulation code (ED/DMRG)
2. Save outputs in NumPy compressed format (.npz)
3. Ensure arrays are named according to the schema in the main README

## File Format

See the main `README.md` in this directory for detailed format specifications.
